            "Bangladesh,[a] officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh,[b] is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous country in the world and among the most densely populated with a population of over 171 million within an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. It has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal to its south and is separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the Indian state of Sikkim to its north. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's political, financial, and cultural centre. Chittagong is the second-largest city and the busiest port of the country.\n",
            "The territory of modern Bangladesh was a stronghold of many Hindu and Buddhist dynasties in ancient history. Following the Muslim conquest in 1204, the region saw Sultanate and Mughal rule. During the Mughal period, particularly under the Bengal Subah, the region emerged as one of the most prosperous and commercially active parts of the world, known for its thriving textile industry and agricultural productivity. The Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of British colonial rule for the following two centuries. In the aftermath of the Partition of India in 1947, East Bengal became the eastern and most populous wing of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan and was later renamed to East Pakistan.\n",
            "Following over two decades of political repression and systemic racism from the West Pakistan–based government, East Pakistan experienced a civil war in 1971, ultimately leading to a war for independence. The Mukti Bahini, with aid and assistance from Indian forces, waged a successful armed revolution; and despite a genocide perpetrated by Pakistan, Bangladesh became a sovereign nation on 16 December 1971. Post-Independence, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led the country until his assassination in 1975. Presidency was later transferred to Ziaur Rahman, who himself was assassinated in 1981. The 1980s were dominated by the dictatorship of Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who was overthrown in a mass uprising in 1990. Following the democratisation in 1991, the \"Battle of the Begums\" between Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina defined the country's politics for the next three decades. Hasina was overthrown in a July Revolution in August 2024, and an Interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.\n",
            "Bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary republic based on the Westminster system. It is a middle power with the second-largest economy in South Asia. Bangladesh is home to the fourth-largest Muslim population in the world. It maintains the third-largest military in South Asia and is the largest contributor to the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations. It consists of eight divisions, 64 districts, and 495 sub-districts, and is home to the largest mangrove forest in the world. However, Bangladesh has one of the largest refugee populations in the world and continues to face challenges such as endemic corruption, lack of human rights, political instability, and adverse effects of climate change. It has twice chaired the Climate Vulnerable Forum and is a member of BIMSTEC, SAARC, OIC and the Commonwealth of Nations.\n",
            "Etymology\n",
            "The etymology of Bangladesh (\"Bengali country\") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such as Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy by Rabindranath Tagore and Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo by Kazi Nazrul Islam, used the term in 1905 and 1932 respectively.[18] Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in East Pakistan.\n",
            "The term Bangla is a major name for both the Bengal region and the Bengali language. The origins of the term Bangla are unclear, with theories pointing to a Bronze Age proto-Dravidian tribe,[19] and the Iron Age Vanga Kingdom.[20] The earliest known usage of the term is the Nesari plate in 805 AD. The term Vangala Desa is found in 11th-century South Indian records.[21][22] The term gained official status during the Sultanate of Bengal in the 14th century.[23][24] Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah proclaimed himself as the first \"Shah of Bangala\" in 1342.[23] The word Bangāl became the most common name for the region during the Islamic period.[25] 16th-century historian Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak mentions in his Ain-i-Akbari that the addition of the suffix \"al\" came from the fact that the ancient rajahs of the land raised mounds of earth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called \"al\".[26] This is also mentioned in Ghulam Husain Salim's Riyaz-us-Salatin.[27]\n",
            "The Indo-Aryan suffix Desh is derived from the Sanskrit word deśha, which means \"land\" or \"country\". Hence, the name Bangladesh means \"Land of Bengal\" or \"Country of Bengal\".[22]\n",
            "History\n",
            "Early history\n",
            "The first great indigenous empire to cover the territory was the Maurya Empire (c. 320–185 BC). Following its decline, the kingdom of Samatata arose, which was a tributary state of the Gupta Empire (ca. 319-ca. 540 AD). Harsha (606–47 AD) drew Samatata into its loosely administered political structure. The Buddhist Pala Empire ruled the region from 750 to 1150 AD. It was overthrown by the Hindu Sena dynasty, which ruled the territory until the Muslim conquests led by Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji of the Ghurid dynasty in 1204.[28]\n",
            "Medieval period\n",
            "Bengal was then incorporated into the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 AD).[29] In 1341, the independent Bengal Sultanate was established by Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah.[29] Amidst geographic expansion and economic prosperity, it was regarded by European and Chinese visitors as the \"richest country to trade with\".[30]: 10 The Mughal Empire conquered Bengal in 1576.[29][31] By the 18th century, the Bengal Subah emerged as the wealthiest province of the empire and was described as the \"Paradise of Countries\" and the \"breadbasket of India\".[29] Its citizens enjoyed some of the best standards of living in the world, as the region was a major global exporter and producer of cotton textiles (muslin in particular), silk and shipbuilding.[32]: 174 Following the decline of the Mughal Empire in the early 1700s, the region became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, founded by Murshid Quli Khan in 1717.\n",
            "British colonial rule\n",
            "On 23 June 1757, the state led by Siraj-ud-Daulah was defeated by the British East India Company in the Battle of Plassey—which was key in establishing colonial British rule over Bengal and the wider Indian subcontinent. Bengal played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution at the expense of an extraordinary capital flight and deindustrialisation following British colonial loot and the collapse of the Bengali textile industry.[33][32]: 7–10 The catastrophic Great Bengal famine of 1770 caused over ten million deaths,[34] killing one-third of the total population of the Bengal Presidency,[35]: 47 and remains one of the deadliest man-made famines in history.\n",
            "As part of Pakistan\n",
            "In the aftermath of direct British rule for nearly two centuries, the borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal between India and Pakistan by the Radcliffe Line[36] during the partition of India on 15 August 1947, when the region became East Bengal as the eastern and most populous wing of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan—alongside West Pakistan.[37] The western and eastern wings of the newly formed Pakistan were geographically separated by a distance of over 1,000 miles, which became the root cause of deep economic inequality.[38] Khawaja Nazimuddin was East Bengal's first chief minister with Frederick Chalmers Bourne its governor. The All Pakistan Awami Muslim League was formed in 1949. In 1950, the East Bengal Legislative Assembly enacted land reform, abolishing the Permanent Settlement and the zamindari system.[39] The Awami Muslim League was renamed as a more \"secular\" Awami League in 1953.[40] The first constituent assembly was dissolved in 1954. The United Front coalition swept aside the Muslim League in a landslide victory in the 1954 East Bengali legislative election. The following year, East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan as part of the One Unit programme, and the province became a vital part of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.\n",
            "Amidst rising cultural and societal differences—the brutal government crackdown on the 1952 Bengali language movement to establish Bengali as the official language of Pakistan spurred Bengali nationalism and pro-democracy movements. Pakistan adopted a new constitution in 1956.[41] The Pakistan Armed Forces imposed martial law in 1958, following a coup d'état, with Ayub Khan establishing a dictatorship for over a decade. A new constitution was introduced in 1962, replacing the parliamentary system with a presidential and gubernatorial system (based on electoral college selection) known as \"Basic Democracy\".[42] In 1962, Dhaka became the seat of the National Assembly of Pakistan, a move seen as appeasing increased Bengali nationalism.[43] In 1966, Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced a six-point movement for a federal parliamentary democracy.\n",
            "Ethnic, linguistic, and cultural discrimination was common in Pakistan's civil and military services, in which Bengalis were under-represented;[44] leading to East Pakistan forging a distinct political identity.[45] Authorities banned Bengali literature and music in the state media.[46] The Pakistani government practised extensive economic discrimination against East Pakistan, including the refusal for foreign aid allocation.[47] Despite generating 70% of Pakistan's export revenue with jute and tea, East Pakistan received much less government spending. Notable economists from East Pakistan, including Rehman Sobhan and Nurul Islam demanded a separate foreign exchange account for the eastern wing, also pointing to the existence of two different economies within Pakistan itself, dubbed the Two-Economies Theory.[48][49] The populist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested for treason in the Agartala Conspiracy Case and was released during the 1969 uprising in East Pakistan which resulted in Ayub Khan's resignation. General Yahya Khan assumed power, reintroducing martial law.\n",
            "After the Pakistan Government's poor response to the 1970 Bhola Cyclone which left over 500,000 people dead,[50] Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani a prominent political figure who had previously led multiple rebellion against the British Raj was the first ever Bengali to declare independence of East Pakistan in a massive public rally on 23 November 1970 but it was not officially recognized.[51][52] After the December 1970 elections, the Bengali-nationalist Awami League won 167 of 169 East Pakistani seats in the National Assembly. The League claimed the right to form a government and develop a new constitution but was strongly opposed by the Pakistani military and the Pakistan Peoples Party led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\n",
            "The 7 March Speech of Mujib led to a non-cooperation movement. The autocratic Pakistani government then initiated Operation Searchlight on 25 March 1971 in response.[53] Mujib signed the Proclamation of Independence on 26 March 1971, Major Ziaur Rahman publicly broadcast Mujib's message the following day.[54] Zia's message stated the following day. A nine-month-long bloody liberation war, begun which led to a genocide,[55] and the culmination of Bangladesh as a sovereign nation following Pakistani surrender on 16 December 1971.\n",
            "Independent Bangladesh\n",
            "The Constitution of Bangladesh was enacted on 4 November 1972.[56] Following independence, the Mujib-led government engaged in large-scale corruption and mismanagement, leading to nationwide lawlessness and economic devastation. Efforts to establish One-party socialism and a large famine in 1974 led to Mujib's assassination in 1975 following a significant decline in his popularity.[57][58]: 131 The presidency was then transferred to Ziaur Rahman, who re-established public order, industrialised agriculture, founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and initiated the creation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.[59] Following Rahman's assassination in 1981, the ensuing decade was a military dictatorship under Hussain Muhammad Ershad that saw infrastructural development, devolution reforms, privatisation of nationalised industries and the declaration of Islam as the state religion in 1988.[60][61][62][63]\n",
            "After the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1991, power alternated between Khaleda Zia of the BNP and Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, an era dubbed the \"Battle of the Begums\"—which defined Bangladesh's politics and history for next 18 years.[64][58]: 130 Following the return of the Awami League to power after the 2008 general election[65] the country under Sheikh Hasina's leadership saw economic progress but also witnessed democratic backsliding, increasing authoritarianism, endemic corruption, and widespread human rights abuses.[66] According to various reports Hasina and the Awami League Government, aided by cooperation with India, organized the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles revolt to kill capable army officers whom Hasina deemed a threat to her power destabilizing the Bangladesh Army and solidifying de facto one party rule.[67][68] Hasina won her second, third and fourth consecutive terms in the 2014, 2018 and the 2024 general elections—all of which were shams and neither free nor fair.[69][70][71] Following a July Revolution against the authoritarian government, Hasina was forced to resign and flee to India on 5 August 2024.[72] An interim government was formed on 8 August 2024, with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the Chief Adviser.[73]\n",
            "Since the early 1990s, driven by free market policies and economic liberalisation measures, Bangladesh has achieved significant economic growth—emerging as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, driven by its large textile industry, which is the second-largest in the world.[74] It has emerged as the second-largest economy in South Asia, achieving comparable nominal GDP per capita to that of neighbouring India.[75][76] Bangladesh has achieved remarkable feats in reducing its poverty rate, which has gone down from 80% in 1971,[77] to 44.2% in 1991,[78] and all the way down to 18.7% in 2022.[79] Its Human Development Index growth during the 21st century was surpassed only by China.[80] As part of the green transition, Bangladesh's industrial sector emerged as a leader in building green factories, with the country having the largest number of certified green factories in the world.[81] It has also given shelter to over a million Rohingya refugees fleeing the Rohingya genocide since 2017, which has strained its resources and highlighted its humanitarian commitments.[82]\n",
            "Geography\n",
            "Bangladesh is in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares a small border with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, the largest river delta in the world.[83] The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges.\n",
            "The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name Padma or Pôdda), Brahmaputra (Jamuna or Jomuna), and Meghna rivers and their tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is called the \"Land of Rivers\",[84] as it is home to over 57 trans-boundary rivers, the most of any nation-state. Water issues are politically complicated since Bangladesh is downstream of India.[85]\n",
            "Bangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land. Most of it is less than 12 m (39 ft) above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m (3.3 ft).[86] 12% of the country is covered by hill systems. The country's haor wetlands are of significance to global environmental science. The highest point in Bangladesh is the Saka Haphong, located near the border with Myanmar, with an elevation of 1,064 m (3,491 ft).[87] Previously, either Keokradong or Tazing Dong were considered the highest.\n",
            "In Bangladesh forest cover is around 14% of the total land area, equivalent to 1,883,400 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 1,920,330 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 1,725,330 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 158,070 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 33% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.[88][89]\n",
            "Climate\n",
            "Straddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladesh's climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0 °C (32 °F), with a record low of 1.1 °C (34.0 °F) in the northwest city of Dinajpur on 3 February 1905.[90] A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores occur almost every year,[91] combined with the effects of deforestation, soil degradation and erosion. The cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, the latter killing approximately 140,000 people.[92]\n",
            "In September 1998, Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding in modern history, after which two-thirds of the country went underwater, along with a death toll of 1,000.[93] As a result of various international and national level initiatives in disaster risk reduction, the human toll and economic damage from floods and cyclones have come down over the years.[94] The 2007 South Asian floods ravaged areas across the country, leaving five million people displaced, with a death toll around 500.[95]\n",
            "Climate change\n",
            "Bangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.[96][97] Over the course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 per cent of which are believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh.[98] Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter.[99] It is estimated that by 2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 per cent of the land and displace more than 30 million people.[100] To address the sea level rise threat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched.[101][102]\n",
            "Biodiversity\n",
            "Bangladesh is located in the Indomalayan realm, and lies within four terrestrial ecoregions: Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests, Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests, Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests, and Sundarbans mangroves.[103] Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerous rivers and tributaries, lakes, wetlands, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moist deciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile alluvial soil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of mango, jackfruit, bamboo, betel nut, coconut, and date palm.[104] The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants.[105] Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants. Water lilies and lotuses grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has 50 wildlife sanctuaries.\n",
            "Bangladesh is home to most of the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, covering an area of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries: the South, East, and West zones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, a unique ecosystem. It also includes tropical and subtropical coniferous forests, a freshwater swamp forest, and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern Chittagong region covers evergreen and semi-evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along with the districts of Gazipur, Tangail, and Mymensingh. St. Martin's Island is the only coral reef in the country.\n",
            "Bangladesh has an abundance of wildlife in its forests, marshes, woodlands, and hills.[104] The vast majority of animals dwell within a habitat of 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi).[106] The Bengal tiger, clouded leopard, saltwater crocodile, black panther and fishing cat are among the chief predators in the Sundarbans.[107] Northern and eastern Bangladesh is home to the Asian elephant, hoolock gibbon, Asian black bear and oriental pied hornbill.[108] The chital deer are widely seen in southwestern woodlands. Other animals include the black giant squirrel, capped langur, Bengal fox, sambar deer, jungle cat, king cobra, wild boar, mongooses, pangolins, pythons and water monitors. Bangladesh has one of the largest populations of Irrawaddy and Ganges dolphins.[109] The country has numerous species of amphibians (53), reptiles (139), marine reptiles (19) and marine mammals (5). It also has 628 species of birds.[110]\n",
            "Several animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one-horned and two-horned rhinoceros and common peafowl. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, limiting deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. The country has widespread environmental issues; pollution of the Dhaleshwari River by the textile industry and shrimp cultivation in Chakaria Sundarbans have both been described by academics as ecocides.[111][112] Although many areas are protected under law, some Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. The Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions as Ecologically Critical Areas, including wetlands, forests, and rivers. The Sundarbans tiger project and the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.[108] It ratified the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 3 May 1994.[113] As of 2014[update], the country was set to revise its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.[113]\n",
            "Government and politics\n",
            "Bangladesh, by constitution, is a unitary state[114] and a de jure representative democracy with a Westminster-style parliamentary system[58] that has universal suffrage.[115] The government can be divided into three pillars: the executive, the legislative and the judiciary. All function to ensure accountability, transparency and checks and balances.[114] Since its independence, the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have remained two of the most powerful political parties in Bangladesh.[58]\n",
            "- The first pillar of the government is the executive organ, which is entrusted with the administration of the country.[114] Executive powers are largely vested in the Prime Minister, who is the head of government and oversees the cabinet.[114] The tenure of a parliamentary government is five years. Various ministers form the bulk of the executive organ, overseeing government departments and forming policies.[114] The Civil Service assists the ministers in implementing policy.[114] All authorities unite to formulate policies, manage public services, and implement national development plans.[114] The President is the ceremonial head of state, whose powers include signing bills passed by parliament into law, maintaining the government's stability and continuity,[114] and fulfilling their duties as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces[116] and the chancellor of all universities.[117]\n",
            "- The second pillar of the government is the legislative organ, also known as the Jatiya Sangsad (House of the Nation).[118] Citizens elect the members of parliament (MPs).[114] The unicameral parliament has 350 MPs, including 300 elected on the first past the post system and 50 appointed to reserved seats for women's empowerment.[118][119] Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh forbids MPs from voting against their party.[120] The parliament is presided over by the Speaker, who is second in line to the president.[121]\n",
            "- The third pillar of the government is the judiciary organ, which is in charge of interpreting the law, resolving conflicts, and maintaining justice.[114] The Supreme Court is the highest court, separated into the Appellate Division and the High Court Division.[122][114] It is led by the Chief Justice.[122] The judiciary has the power to assess a law's constitutionality and offer legal remedies. It protects citizens' rights, ensures the law is applied fairly, and preserves the balance of power within the government.[114] The courts have wide latitude in judicial review, and judicial precedent is supported by Article 111 of the constitution.[123] The judiciary includes district and metropolitan courts divided into civil and criminal courts. Due to a shortage of judges, the judiciary has a large backlog.[124]\n",
            "According to International IDEA’s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, Bangladesh performs in the low range on overall democratic measures, with particular weaknesses in political representation, including credible elections, inclusive suffrage and elected government.[125][126][127]\n",
            "Administrative divisions\n",
            "Bangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions,[128][87][129] each named after its headquarters: Barisal (officially Barishal[130]), Chittagong (officially Chattogram[130]), Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.\n",
            "Divisions are subdivided into districts (zila). Bangladesh has 64 districts, each subdivided into upazila (subdistricts) or thana. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into unions, with each union comprising multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, further divided into mahallas.\n",
            "There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration comprises only government officials. Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson and several members. In 1997, Parliament passed legislation reserving three seats (out of 12) in every union for women.[131]\n",

            "Bangladesh is considered a middle power in global politics.[134] It plays an important role in the geopolitical affairs of the Indo-Pacific,[135] due to its strategic location between South and Southeast Asia.[136] Bangladesh joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1972 and the United Nations in 1974.[137][138] It relies on multilateral diplomacy on issues like climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, trade policy and non-traditional security issues.[139] Bangladesh pioneered the creation of SAARC, the preeminent forum for regional diplomacy on the Indian subcontinent.[140] It joined the OIC in 1974,[141] and is a founding member of the Developing-8.[142] Recently, Bangladesh has focused on promoting regional trade and transport links with support from the World Bank.[143] It is also attempting to join ASEAN as one of its top foreign policy goals.[144][145][146] Dhaka hosts the headquarters of BIMSTEC, an organisation that brings together countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal.\n",
            "Relations with neighbouring Myanmar have been severely strained since 2016–2017, after over 700,000 Rohingya refugees illegally entered Bangladesh.[147] Bangladesh's parliament, government, and civil society have been at the forefront of international criticism against Myanmar for military operations against the Rohingya, and have demanded their right of return to Arakan.[148][149]\n",
            "Bangladesh shares an important bilateral and economic relationship with its largest neighbour, India,[150] which is often strained by water politics of the Ganges and the Teesta,[151][152][153] and the border killings of Bangladeshi civilians.[154][155] Bangladesh's relationship with Pakistan is problematic, mainly because Pakistan denies the 1971 Bangladesh genocide.[156] It maintains a warm relationship with China, its largest trading partner and largest arms supplier.[157] Japan is Bangladesh's largest economic aid provider, and the two have a strategic and economic partnership.[158] Political relations with Middle Eastern countries are robust.[159] Bangladesh receives 59% of its remittances from the Middle East,[160] despite poor working conditions affecting over four million Bangladeshi workers.[161] Bangladesh plays a major role in global climate diplomacy as a leader of the Climate Vulnerable Forum.[162]\n",
            "Military\n",
            "The Bangladesh Armed Forces have inherited the institutional framework of the British military and the British Indian Army.[163] In 2024, the active personnel strength of the Bangladesh Armed Forces was around 230,000,[164] including the Air Force (21,000) and the Navy (27,000).[165] In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has supported civil authorities in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest. For many years, Bangladesh has been the world's largest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces.[166] The military budget of Bangladesh accounts for 1.3% of GDP, amounting to US$4.3 billion in 2021.[167][168]\n",
            "The Bangladesh Navy, one of the largest in the Bay of Bengal, includes a fleet of frigates, submarines, corvettes, and other vessels. The Bangladesh Air Force has a small fleet of multi-role combat aircraft. Most of Bangladesh's military equipment comes from China.[169] In recent years, Bangladesh and India have increased joint military exercises, high-level visits of military leaders, counter-terrorism cooperation and intelligence sharing. Bangladesh is vital to ensuring stability and security in northeast India.[170][171]\n",
            "Bangladesh's strategic importance in the eastern subcontinent hinges on its proximity to China, its frontier with Burma, the separation of mainland and northeast India, and its maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal.[172] In 2002, Bangladesh and China signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement.[173] The United States has pursued negotiations with Bangladesh on a Status of forces agreement, an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement and a General Security of Military Information Agreement.[174][175][176] In 2019, Bangladesh ratified the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[177]\n",
            "Civil society\n",
            "Since the colonial period, Bangladesh has had a prominent civil society. There are various special interest groups, including non-governmental organisations, human rights organisations, professional associations, chambers of commerce, employers' associations, and trade unions.[178] The National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh was set up in 2007. Notable human rights organisations and initiatives include the Centre for Law and Mediation, Odhikar, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee. The world's largest international NGO BRAC is based in Bangladesh. There has been concern about the shrinking space for independent civil society in recent years.[179][180][181]\n",
            "Human rights\n",
            "Torture is banned by the Constitution of Bangladesh,[183] but is rampantly used by Bangladesh's security forces. Bangladesh joined the Convention against Torture in 1998 and enacted its first anti-torture law, the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, in 2013. The first conviction under this law was announced in 2020.[184] Amnesty International Prisoners of Conscience from Bangladesh have included Saber Hossain Chowdhury and Shahidul Alam.[185][186] The widely criticised Digital Security Act was repealed and replaced by the Cyber Security Act in 2023.[187] The repeal was welcomed by the International Press Institute.[188]\n",
            "On International Human Rights Day in December 2021, the United States Department of the Treasury announced sanctions on commanders of the Rapid Action Battalion for extrajudicial killings, torture, and other human rights abuses.[189] Freedom House has criticised the government for human rights abuses, the crackdown on the opposition, mass media, and civil society through politicised enforcement.[190] Bangladesh is ranked \"partly free\" in Freedom House's Freedom in the World report,[191] but its press freedom has deteriorated from \"free\" to \"not free\" in recent years due to increasing government pressure.[192] According to the British Economist Intelligence Unit, the country has a hybrid regime: the third of four rankings in its Democracy Index.[193] Bangladesh ranked 96th among 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index.[194] According to National Human Rights Commission, 70% of alleged human-rights violations are committed by law-enforcement agencies.[195]\n",
            "LGBT rights are frowned upon among social conservatives.[196] Homosexuality is affected by Section 377 of the Penal Code of Bangladesh, originally enacted by the British colonial government.[197][198] The government only recognises the transgender and intersex community known as the Hijra.[199][200] According to the 2023 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 1.2 million people were enslaved in Bangladesh as of 2021[update], which is among the highest in the world.[201]\n",
            "Corruption\n",
            "Like many developing countries, institutional corruption is an issue of concern for Bangladesh. Bangladesh ranked 146th among 180 countries on Transparency International's 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index.[202] Land administration was the sector with the most bribery in 2015,[203] followed by education,[204] police[205] and water supply.[206] The Anti Corruption Commission was formed in 2004, and was active during the 2006–08 Bangladeshi political crisis, indicting many leading politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen for graft.[207][208][209]\n",
            "Economy\n",
            "Bangladesh is a lower-middle income mixed-market economy.[210][211] It has the world's 36th-largest economy by nominal terms, and the 24th-largest by PPP. Bangladesh has a labour force of 71.4 million,[212] which is the world's seventh-largest; with an unemployment rate of 5.1% as of 2023[update].[213] Its foreign exchange reserves, although depleting,[214] remain the second-highest in South Asia, after India. Bangladesh's large diaspora contributed roughly $27 billion in remittances in 2024.[215] The Bangladeshi taka is the national currency.\n",
            "As of 2023[update], the large service sector accounts for about 51.5% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (34.6%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up only 11% of total GDP;[8] despite being the largest employment sector, providing roughly half of the total workforce.[216] Over 84% of the export earnings come from the textile industry.[217] Bangladesh is the second-leading garments exporter in the world, and plays a crucial role in the global fast fashion industry, exporting to various Western fashion brands.[218] It is also a major producer of jute,[219] rice,[220] fish,[221] tea,[222] and flowers.[223] Other major industries include shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, steel, electronics and leather goods.[224] China is the largest trading partner of Bangladesh, accounting for 15% of the total trade, followed by India; which accounts for 8% of the total trade.[225]\n",
            "The private sector accounts for 80% of GDP compared to the dwindling role of state-owned companies.[226] Bangladesh's economy is dominated by family-owned conglomerates and small and medium-sized businesses. Some of the largest publicly traded companies in Bangladesh include BEXIMCO, BRAC Bank, BSRM, GPH Ispat, Grameenphone, Summit Group, and Square Pharmaceuticals.[227] The Dhaka and Chittagong Stock Exchanges are the country's twin capital markets.[228] Its telecommunications industry is one of the world's fastest growing, with 188.78 million cellphone subscribers at the end of November 2024.[229] Political instability,[230] high inflation,[231] endemic corruption,[232] insufficient power supplies,[233] and slow implementation of reforms are major challenges to economic growth.[231]\n",

            "Energy\n",
            "Bangladesh, a country experiencing daily blackouts several times a day in 2009, achieved 100% electrification by 2022.[235][236] It is gradually transitioning to a green economy and has the largest off-grid solar power programme in the world, benefiting 20 million people.[237] An electric car called the Palki is being developed for production in the country.[238] Biogas is being used to produce organic fertiliser.[239] The under-construction Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, under-construction with assistance from the Russian company Rosatom, will be the first operational nuclear power plant in the country. Its first unit, out of the two total units, is expected to go into operation in 2025.[240]\n",
            "Bangladesh continues to have huge untapped reserves of natural gas, particularly in its maritime territory.[241][242] A lack of exploration and decreasing proven reserves have forced Bangladesh to import LNG from abroad.[243][244][245] Gas shortages were further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[246] Bangladesh stopped buying spot price LNG temporarily in July 2022, despite constant load-shedding, due to a steep price hike in the global market.[247] It restarted buying spot price LNG once again in February 2023 as prices eased.[248]\n",
            "While government-owned companies in Bangladesh generate nearly half of Bangladesh's electricity, privately owned companies like the Summit Group and Orion Group are playing an increasingly important role in both generating electricity, and supplying machinery, reactors, and equipment.[249] Bangladesh increased electricity production capacity from 5 gigawatts in 2009 to 25.5 gigawatts in 2022. It plans to further increase it to 50 gigawatts by 2041. US companies like Chevron and General Electric supply around 55% of Bangladesh's domestic natural gas production and are among the largest investors in power projects. 80% of Bangladesh's installed gas-fired power generation capacity comes from turbines manufactured in the United States.[250]\n",
            "Tourism\n",
            "The tourism industry is expanding, contributing some 3.02% of total GDP.[251] Bangladesh's international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $391 million.[252] The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites (the Mosque City, the Buddhist Vihara and the Sundarbans) and seven tentative-list sites.[253] The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2019 that the travel and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly generated 1,180,500 jobs in 2018 or 1.9% of the country's total employment.[254] According to the same report, Bangladesh experiences around 125,000 international tourist arrivals per year.[254] Domestic spending generated 97.7 per cent of direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012.[255]\n",

Other highly consumed fishes include rohu, pangas, and tilapia.[429] Lobsters, shrimps and dried fish (shutki) also play an important role, with the chingri malai curry being a famous shrimp dish.[426]: 8 In Chittagong, famous dishes include kala bhuna and mezban, the latter being a traditionally popular feast, featuring the serving of mezbani gosht, a hot and spicy beef curry.[426]: 10 [427][430] In Sylhet, the shatkora lemons are used to marinate dishes, a notable one is beef hatkora.[430] Among the tribal communities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, cooking with bamboo shoots is popular.[431] Khulna is renowned for using chui jhal (piper chaba) in its meat-based dishes.[430][427]\n",
            "Bangladesh has a vast spread of desserts, including distinctive sweets such as the rôshogolla, roshmalai, chomchom, sondesh, mishti doi and kalojaam, and jilapi.[432] Pithas are traditional boiled desserts made with rice or fruits.[433] Halwa, shemai and falooda, the latter two being a variation of vermicelli; are popular desserts during religious festivities.[434][435][436] Ruti, naan, paratha, luchi and bakarkhani are the main local breads.[437][427] Hot milk tea is the most commonly consumed beverage in the country, being at the centre of group conversations.[438] Borhani, mattha and lassi are popular traditionally consumed beverages.[439][440] Kebabs are widely popular, particularly seekh kebab, chapli kebab, shami kebab, chicken tikka and shashlik, along with various types of chaaps.[427] Popular street foods include chotpoti, jhal muri, shingara,[441] samosa and fuchka.[442]\n",
            "Sports\n",
            "In rural Bangladesh, several traditional indigenous sports such as Kabaddi, Boli Khela, Lathi Khela and Nouka Baich remain fairly popular. While Kabaddi is the national sport,[443] Cricket is arguably the most popular sport in the country. The national cricket team participated in their first Cricket World Cup in 1999 and the following year was granted Test cricket status. Bangladesh reached the quarter-final of the 2015 Cricket World Cup, the semi-final of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy and they reached the final of the Asia Cup 3 times – in 2012, 2016, and 2018. Shakib Al Hasan is widely regarded as one of the greatest all-rounders in the history of the sport.[444] In 2020, the Bangladesh national under-19 cricket team won the men's Under-19 Cricket World Cup.[445][446] The Bangladesh national under-19 cricket team also won the U-19 Asia cup in 2023 and 2024 consecutively.[447][448] In 2018, the Bangladesh women's national cricket team won the 2018 Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup.[449]\n",
            "Football is the second-most popular sport in Bangladesh, following cricket.[450] The first instance of a national football team was the emergence of the Shadhin Bangla football team during the liberation war of 1971.[451] On 25 July 1971, the team's captain, Zakaria Pintoo, became the first person to hoist the Bangladesh flag on foreign land before their match in neighbouring India.[452] Following independence, the national football team made its debut in 1973 and eventually achieved the feat of participating in the AFC Asian Cup (1980), becoming only the second South Asian team to do so.[453] Bangladesh's most notable achievements in football include the 2003 SAFF Gold Cup and 1999 South Asian Games. The Bangladesh women's national football team won the SAFF Women's Championship consecutively in 2022 and 2024.[454]\n",
            "Bangladesh archers Ety Khatun and Roman Sana won several gold medals winning all the 10 archery events (both individual and team events) in the 2019 South Asian Games.[455] The National Sports Council regulates 42 sporting federations.[456] Chess is very popular in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has five grandmasters in chess. Among them, Niaz Murshed was the first grandmaster in South Asia.[457] In 2010, mountain climber Musa Ibrahim became the first Bangladeshi climber to conquer Mount Everest.[458] Wasfia Nazreen is the first Bangladeshi climber to climb the Seven Summits and the K2.[459][460]\n",
